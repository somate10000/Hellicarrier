Instruction
Make your own decisions whenever you find the task unclear.
Suppose you can’t get one thing to work. Proceed to the next step, We’d prefer if you have worked on every aspect a bit over getting only the display perfectly done.

Task
Implement a simple app with the wireframe design below that shows a view of a mock dataset grouped by their date of creation and can be filtered by their types or status of data with a specific filter component and also can be searched through with a search box.

Requirements
TECHNOLOGY: React or React Native and GraphQL.
Use a fake GraphQL API to mock data of your choice with at least 20 rows of data groups with five different dates. For instance, you can think of a very simple transaction history page with the following columns: ID, Status, Date, Name, and Type. Please note that this is just a suggestion and you can choose another use case.
If you click on a filter or use the search box, only the data containing the value should be shown.
OPTIONAL: If you have some ideas, briefly describe your experience with the usability of this app and how it can be improved.
OPTIONAL: if you are chanced, you can make the search components work for all the columns except the unique value column e.g ID.
Dependencies used (React, React Native, GraphQL, NodeJs, Express, Apollo)
Express, NodeJs are used creating and hosting DATABASE
GraphQl, is used to make the individual queries to the DATABASE
Apollo is used to link the the React App with GraphQl
React Native is used to build the front-end
